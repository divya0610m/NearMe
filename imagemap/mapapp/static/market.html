                The Kasimedu fish market, known for selling fish wholesale, is set amidst the bustling neighbourhood of Royapuram, 
                within the Chennai Fishing Harbour. This part of Chennai, from the north of Marina beach onwards, is also known as
                Vada (North) Chennai, and is home to thousands of daily wage workers who work as sanitation staff, auto drivers, hawkers, 
                peddlers, and so on.In the last decade, Vada Chennai has inspired some of the best gangster sagas in Tamil, such as Madras and Vada Chennai. 
                Popular narratives often portray this part of Chennai as rather menacing; what tends to be overlooked is how its 
                inhabitants constantly strive for upward mobility in spite of numerous setbacks. An important manifestation of this 
                everyday struggle can be seen in the Kasimedu fish market.
